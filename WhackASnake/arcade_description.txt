Welcome to Whack-A-Snake!

There are two game modes here:
1. Hit or Lose:
Whack the snakes that pop up and be quick because you only have three seconds. 
As your score increases, your time to whack decreases (min time is around 1.5s). 
Score only increases (by 1) when all snakes are whacked.
Do not whack empty holes and whack all snakes!

2. Quick Whacks: 
Just whack every snake in sight as fast as your fingers allow you. 
You have one minute to score the highest you can! Score increases per snake. 
Hitting empty holes or not hitting all snakes will not cause you to lose. 
Yes, you can treat it like a clicker but accuracy is also measured!

Use the trackpad to whack! 

Feel free to tweak anything your heart desires :D
