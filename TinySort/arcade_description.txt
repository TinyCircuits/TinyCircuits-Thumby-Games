Welcome to TinySort, a very simple sorting game!

Sort the hearts and stars and discard the bombs! 
Hearts go in the H (heart) box and stars in the S (star) box.

Controls:
L: Put in heart box
R: Put in star box
U/D: discard
Note: Only discard bombs!

You have 60 seconds to get the highest score you can get :D
But be careful because items start appearing faster each time!
