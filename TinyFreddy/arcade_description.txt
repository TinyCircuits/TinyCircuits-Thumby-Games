Tiny Freddy: 100% complete version

Ready for the smallest scares you've ever seen?

Tiny Freddy is an accurate recreation of fnaf 1's gameplay, with a few changes to create a more fair and more threatening gameplay experience (as well as to accomodate the smaller screen size and lack of control options).

How To Play:
-press down on the title screen, not A, in order to continue to the other menu options
-if you're selecting custom night, press left while selecting freddy to change golden freddy's AI values
-when in the office...
   -press left and right to look around
   -press B to use your door lights
   -press A to use your doors
-when in the cameras...
   -press left and right to scroll to different cameras
   -hold a to use the map
   -press all directional keys while the map is open to switch cameras faster
   -some cameras may hide characters better than others, freddy and bonnie have a few cameras where they aren't easy to spot, so keep your eyes peeled!

Freddy and golden freddy's AI have been tweaked to nerf freddy at higher AI levels and turn golden freddy into more of a threat. Specifically:
-Freddy's camera stall duration decreases significantly less as his AI gets higher
-Golden freddy has around a 40% chance to appear at AI level 20 anytime the camera is lowered, a chance that decreases the lower his AI level is proportionally

Note that this game contains audio, and the advantages it provides can be helpful when the screen is barely visible. For physical play, try playing it in a quite room to help clue you in on the location of various animatronics.
