The Legend of Thelda (DEMO)

This is an ongoing attempt to recreate the NES classic
of a similar title for the Thumby console.  

It's dangerous to go alone!
Don't forget to grab your sword from the cave on the 
starting map screen.

Currently has six unique enemies.

If you encounter an UNDER CONSTRUCTION screen, 
simply return the way you came.

Access pause menu by pressing "A+B + UP" and exit 
with the same.

Bombs do damage but don't destroy walls yet.
Boomerang works to freeze enemies in place.
Bow is not yet implemented.

Shield can deflect octorok attacks but not zora attacks, 
and only if you're not attacking on impact.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS UNFINISHED

The world isn't fully populated with enemies, the first 
dungeon is still unfinished.  There is currently no actual 
goal for the player to accomplish.  Right now, it's just an
explorable sandbox.

SOON:  The next update should include a larger world map,
 three more enemy types, pushable blocks, spike traps, 
Dungeon Boss 1 and working bow and arrows.

FUTURE:  Shops, loot changes, more enemies, more items, 
music and more sound effects.


The current state of this project has been reached without
using any AI assistance, and is a labor of love and obsession.
