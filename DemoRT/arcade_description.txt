[DemoRT]

A simple raytracing shadow demo written in python and C compiled as an mpy module. 
When running in the emulator a separate reference python only implementation is used.
When running on hardware the single threaded mpy implementation is used to fill the thumby display buffer. 
Mpy uses a 16.16 fixed precision and supports non-firmware unsigned 64 bit and 32 bit floating point oparations with assembly and c implementations. 

To see the mpy implementation, go to the below github and refer to the mpy build instructions using v1.19.1 of micropython.

To see a pure two core C++ implementation using the Arduino and Thumby SDKs go to this github:

Compile with Arduino SDK or install DemoRT.uf2 directly.
