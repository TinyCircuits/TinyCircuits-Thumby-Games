A simple nonogram/picross puzzle game thing, made by Pogostix, ver 1.0, spring 2025.
You can create custom puzzles! Guide included in the files.
Little bit of a turd to run in the emulator, but it CAN be done, check the FAQ at the top of the main file code.
If you have any questions/comments, I can be reached @Pogostix in the Thumby Discord. Enjoy!
