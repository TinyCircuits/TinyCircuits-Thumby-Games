<< HIT and BLOW >>

Let's deduce the hidden four-digit number.
Each of the four digits is different.
For each of your guessed digits, if only the digit is correct, you get a ‘Blow’ hint (represented by △). If both the digit and position are correct, you get a ‘Hit’ hint (represented by ♥).
If you achieve ‘4 Hits’, you've guessed correctly.

Aim to get the correct answer in as few attempts as possible.
