Bounce the ball off the paddle and break some bricks for as long as you can handle it!

The score is kept track through P (short for "Paddle") and T (short for "Total").

Borrows code from Brick'd by Laver√©na W and Annelid by Mason W.

Port of a PC game I'm currently working on in Game Maker Studio 2.
